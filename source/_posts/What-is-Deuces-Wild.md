#  What is Deuces Wild?

Deuces Wild is a type of video poker that is played with a deck of 52 cards. In this game, all the deuces (2s) are wild cards. This means that they can be used as any other card in order to make a winning hand. The other card values are the same as in regular poker.

The object of Deuces Wild is to create the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the seven cards dealt to you. You can hold as many or as few of these cards as you like and exchange the rest for new ones from the deck.

The payouts for Deuces Wild depend on the particular variation you are playing, but typically range from 2x to 4x your bet for a basic Royal Flush.

#  What is the Deuces Wild Game?

The Deuces Wild game is a casino game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The games starts with the player being dealt two cards. In Deuces Wild, all deuces (two) are wild cards. This means that they can be used as any other card in the deck to make a better hand. If the player gets two deuces, they automatically win the hand.

After the player has been dealt their initial two cards, they have the option to draw another card or stand. If they choose to draw another card, they are then dealt one more card face up. He then has the choice to either take this new card and add it to their hand, or discard it and take no further action. If the player stands, then they are finished with their turn and the next player in rotation takes their turn.

The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Winning hands are paid out according to a payout table, which is usually displayed on a sign near the Deuces Wild machine or table. In general, hands which contain at least one Ace or King will payout higher than hands which do not.

# How to Play Deuces Wild?

To play Deuces Wild, you first need to insert your bet into the betting circle. You can then click on the Deal button to begin play. A random number generator will deal out two cards face up for each player, as well as two dealer cards - one face up and one face down. The face up dealer card is called the Up Card.

Your aim is to beat the Up Card using your two cards and any of three community cards (the ones that are turned over). In order to achieve this you need at least a pair worth of points - such as two Jacks - or better still three-of-a-kind or a royal flush. If you don't have anything higher than a pair you lose automatically no matter what your opponent has showing). Winning bets pay out even money - 1-1 odds - minus a five percent commission taken by casino (house edge = 4%). So if you bet 10$ and won you'd collect 11$ total). The exception is when you get natural blackjack; in which case your winning hand would pay 3-2 odds instead (15$ for 10$, 25$ for 20$, etc). 

After all players have completed their turns, if there are any active players remaining in the hand, one more community card is turned over (the Turn Card), followed by another round of betting just like at showdown (except now some people might have hit blackjack so bets could range from 2$ minimum up to thousands), after which players once again show their hands and those still in contention resolve ties using suit order (Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs)). Finally, if there's still more than one active player left after second round of betting (showdown), showdown happens just like normal where only suits break ties rather than ranks). The first person who either bets all of his money or declares himself all-in is forced all-in for purposes of showdown).
