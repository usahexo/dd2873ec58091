This is a type of bet in which the gambler bets on whether the favored team will win by more or less than the point spread. For example, if the Seahawks are playing the 49ers and the spread is 3 points, then a gambler could bet that the Seahawks will win by 4 or more points, or that they will lose by 2 points or less.
