#  Taxpayers earning over $100,000 from gambling in 2016

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has released statistics for the 2016 taxation year, revealing that more than 183,000 taxpayers earned over $100,000 from gambling in 2016.

The ATO’s figures show that this group of high-income earners accounted for almost 63% of the total gambling income reported for the year. The next highest income group was those earning between $50,000 and $99,999, who accounted for just over 27% of the total gambling income.

Overall, the ATO collected more than $2.9 billion in gambling taxes in 2016, up from $2.7 billion in 2015. This represents an increase of 7.5%.

The average taxable income from gambling was $127,000, slightly down on the 2015 figure of $129,000. The median taxable income was $41,000.

Interestingly, while the number of high-earning gamblers increased marginally from 182,000 in 2015 to 183,000 in 2016, their share of the total gambling income decreased from 65% to 63%. This indicates that there was a higher proportion of lower-income earners reporting gambling income in 2016 than in 2015.

The ATO attributes this to the rise in popularity of online sports betting, which is typically favoured by lower-income earners. In contrast, poker and casino games are more commonly played by high-income earners.

According to Assistant Commissioner Kath Anderson: “Online sports betting is now one of Australia’s fastest growing sports supplements and is estimated to be worth up to $400 million a year. While most people gamble within their means and lose more than they win, there are a small minority who make a lot of money from it and need to pay tax on their earnings”.

#  IRS reveals that gambling income has hit a new high

According to the latest report from the IRS, gambling income has hit a new high. In 2015, taxpayers reported nearly $300 billion in gambling income, up from $269 billion in 2014.

Gambling income includes winnings from casinos, lotteries, horse racing, and other forms of gambling. It also includes losses from gambling activities, as well as any prizes or awards won from gambling.

The increase in gambling income is likely due to the increasing popularity of legalized gambling nationwide. Casino revenues have been booming in recent years, and more states are legalizing online gambling and other forms of betting.

Taxpayers who earn income from gambling activities are required to report that income on their tax returns. Gambling income is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and losses can be used to offset other taxable income.

The IRS advises taxpayers that they should keep accurate records of their gambling winnings and losses. This includes receipts, tickets, credit card statements, and other documentation of your gambling activity.

#  Gambling now responsible for 1 in 10 tax returns and $27 billion in income

The Australian gambling industry is booming, with new data revealing that gambling activity is now responsible for one in ten tax returns and $27 billion in income.

The figures, from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), show that gambling activity has surged in recent years, with more than five million people now gambling each week.

This growth is being driven by online gambling, with Australians now spending more than $1.5 billion a year on online casinos, sports betting and other types of gambling.

The ATO’s figures also show that the majority of gambling revenue comes from poker machines, with pokie players spending more than $10 billion a year.

The $27 billion in gambling income accounted for 9.5% of all taxable income in Australia in 2016-17, making it one of the country’s largest industries.

Gambling taxes also raised nearly $2.5 billion for the government during 2016-17, making it an important source of revenue for the government.

This growth is likely to continue in the years ahead, as Australians become increasingly comfortable with gambling online.

#  More Americans are winning big and paying taxes on it

As income inequality has widened in the United States, more and more Americans are finding themselves in the top tax brackets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was passed in 2017, lowered the tax rates for most taxpayers, but it also increased the income thresholds at which those rates apply. This means that more people are now paying taxes on their income at higher marginal tax rates.

In 2018, the top marginal tax rate was 37%, and it applied to taxpayers who earned taxable income of more than $500,000 for single taxpayers and $600,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly. For 2019, the top rate has increased to 38.5%. The new threshold amounts are $612,350 for single taxpayers and $1,246,700 for married taxpayers filing jointly.

As a result of these changes, an increasing number of Americans are finding themselves in the highest tax bracket. In 2018, there were 2.8 million individual taxpayers who had taxable income above $500,000, up from 2.2 million in 2017. And this number is likely to continue to grow as income inequality continues to widen.

So what does this mean for American taxpayers? It means that they could be facing a higher tax bill this year than they did last year. If you earned taxable income of more than $500,000 in 2018, your tax bill may have increased by several thousand dollars. And if you earn taxable income above $1 million, your tax bill could increase by tens of thousands of dollars.

Of course, not everyone who earns taxable income above the threshold amount will actually pay taxes at the top rate. Some will fall into lower tax brackets due to deductions and exemptions available to them. But for those who do end up paying taxes at the top rate, it can be a significant financial burden.

So if you’re one of the many Americans who find yourself in the top tax bracket this year, don’t despair – there are ways to reduce your tax bill. One option is to defer some of your income until next year. This can be done by delaying receipt of bonuses or commissions until 2020 or by selling appreciated assets like stocks or real estate holdings.

Another option is to take advantage of various tax deductions and credits available to high-income taxpayers. Some common deductions include contributions to charity, mortgage interest payments, and state and local taxes paid. And there are a number of credits available as well, such as the credit for child and dependent care expenses and the credit for eligible education expenses.

The bottom line is that if you find yourself in the top tax bracket this year, there are steps you can take to reduce your taxes owed. So don’t worry – you’re not alone!

#  Gambler’s winnings becoming a bigger part of the tax pie

Gambling winnings are becoming an increasingly important source of tax revenue for the U.S. government. According to recently released data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), gambling winnings totaled $59.7 billion in 2017, up from $56.7 billion in 2016 and $50.4 billion in 2015.

The trend is being driven by increased gambling activity across a variety of forms, including casino gaming, lotteries, and sports betting. In fact, the amount of taxes collected from gambling winnings has grown at a faster rate than other major sources of tax revenue such as individual income taxes and corporate income taxes.

Why is this? One reason is that many people are now choosing to gamble online rather than visit land-based casinos. This has allowed the U.S. government to collect more gambling taxes from a wider geographic area. Another reason is that new forms of gambling, such as sports betting, have become more popular in recent years.

For the federal government, gambling taxes are an important source of revenue that can help offset budget deficits. For states, counties, and cities, gambling taxes are an important source of revenue for funding public services and programs.

So far, no major plans have been announced to increase taxes on gambling winnings in order to raise additional revenue for the government. However, it is possible that this could change in the future as policymakers face mounting pressure to address budget deficits and rising levels of national debt
