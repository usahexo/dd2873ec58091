Hey everyone, I'm here to show you how to get addicted to gambling in bitlife in less than 24 hours! This method is very simple and easy to do, so follow these steps carefully.

First, open up bitlife and create a new character. I recommend choosing the "addict" life path, as it will make it much easier to become addicted to gambling.

Once you've created your character, your next step is to find a casino and start gambling. I recommend starting with the low stakes games at first, as it will be easier to build up a addiction this way.

Now, it's time to start gambling! Just keep playing until you lose all of your money. Don't worry, this is exactly what you want to do. The more money you lose, the faster you'll become addicted to gambling.

Once you've run out of money, just go back and gamble some more. Keep doing this until you've lost all of your money. You should be feeling pretty addicted by now!

If you're having trouble losing all of your money, I recommend using the "gamble until bankrupt" cheat code. This will make it much easier for you to lose all your money in a short period of time.

#  Quick tips on how to get addicted to gambling in bitlife!

Gambling addiction is one of the most insidious and harmful addictions a person can have. It destroys families, careers, and lives. Despite this, it is possible to get addicted to gambling in bitlife relatively quickly if you know what you are doing.

The first step is to find a casino or other gambling venue that appeals to you. Once you have found a casino that you like, start by betting small amounts of money. This will help you get comfortable with the game and the casino itself.

As you become more comfortable with gambling, start increasing your bets. However, make sure that you never gamble more than you can afford to lose. Gambling should always be considered a form of entertainment, and not a way to make money.

If you find that you are starting to lose too much money, stop gambling for a while until you can afford to do so again. Gambling should always be enjoyable, and should never cause financial stress.

Finally, remember that gambling is not a guaranteed way to make money. There is always the potential for loss, so never gamble more than you can afford to lose.
