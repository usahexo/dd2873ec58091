#  Chocolate Game Thrills Customers at Hotel and Casino

Gamblers looking for a sweet treat are in luck at the new Chocolate Game at the Hotel and Casino. This exciting new game is played with a deck of ordinary playing cards, but with a chocolate twist.

Each card in the deck has two sides – one with chocolate and one without. During the game, both players keep their cards secret from each other. The game begins by dealing four cards face up on the table. The player with the highest value card (ACE = 1, 2-10 = face value) starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player's turn they must either draw one card from the deck or take all four cards currently on the table.

If a player picks up all four cards, they must put them back down again and then draw another card. If they pick up one card, they can either keep it or put it back down and draw another card. The aim of the game is to collect as many chocolate cards as possible. The first player to accumulate five chocolate cards (or more) wins the game.

The Chocolate Game is a fun and exciting new addition to the casino floor and is sure to thrill customers young and old alike!
