#  How do you pick which place to stay on the beach?

People come to the beach for all types of reasons - some want to relax, some want to surf, and some want to party. So how do you pick which place to stay on the beach? Depending on what you are looking for, different areas might be better for you.

If you are looking for a quiet place to relax, then a smaller town might be a good choice. There will be less people and the beaches will usually be cleaner. Some examples of towns like this are Pacifica in California or Bunbury in Australia.

If you are looking for a place to surf, then you will want to go to a bigger town or city. This is because there will be more waves and it will be easier to find someone who can teach you how to surf. Some cities that are great for surfing include Sydney in Australia and Laguna Beach in California.

If you are looking for a place to party, then you will want to go somewhere with a lot of nightlife. This could be a big city like Los Angeles or Miami, or it could be a small island like Ibiza. No matter what your taste is, there is definitely a place on the beach where you can fit in!

#  What amenities does each location offer?

#  How close to the ocean are they?

Living near the ocean has its perks: salty air, sandy beaches, and stunning sunsets. But how close to the ocean do you have to live in order to reap these benefits?

 surprisingly, you don’t have to live right on the beach to enjoy the salty air and stunning sunsets. in fact, according to a recent study, people who live less than a mile from the coast are more likely to suffer from health problems due to contact with coastal pollution.

the study, conducted by researchers at the university of south carolina, looked at air quality data from more than 100 u.s. cities. they found that people who live within a mile of the coast are more likely to experience respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health issues caused by coastal pollution.

but what causes this pollution? according to the study’s authors, it’s mainly due to emissions from cars and trucks. “coastal living is great, but there are also health risks associated with it,” said one of the authors of the study. “our data show that living near the coast increases your risk for health problems from traffic-related air pollution.”

the good news is that you don’t have to move away from the coast if you want to enjoy its benefits. there are things you can do to reduce your exposure to coastal pollution, such as driving less and taking public transportation when possible. you can also choose restaurants and hotels that are close to public transportation routes instead of ones that are located near busy highways.

so if you’re looking for a little bit of paradise in your life, don’t let coastal pollution scare you away from living near the ocean – just be smart about it!
