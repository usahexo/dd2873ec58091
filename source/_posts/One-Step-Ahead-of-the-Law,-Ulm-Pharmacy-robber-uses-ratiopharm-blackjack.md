Ulm, Germany - Ulm pharmacy robber, known only as Werner, has outsmarted the law using ratiopharm blackjack to get ahead.

A robber in Germany got more than he bargained for when he tried to rob a pharmacy and was met with armed resistance from the store's employees.

#  Ratiopharm Blackjack Used in Pharmacy Robbery

Just two days after a gunman robbed a pharmacy in Manchester, New Hampshire and got away with an unknown amount of prescription drugs, police believe the same man hit a Ratiopharm Pharmacy in Londonderry and got away with narcotics.

The suspect was armed with a black handgun when he entered the Ratiopharm Pharmacy on Thursday night. He jumped the counter, pointed the gun at the pharmacist and demanded drugs. The pharmacist complied and handed over an unknown quantity of narcotics, according to police.

The suspect then ran from the store. Police said they believe he is the same man who robbed the Manchester pharmacy on Monday.

In that robbery, the gunman pointed his gun at a customer and ordered her to hand over her car keys. He drove off in her vehicle, which was found later abandoned.

Police are asking anyone with information about either robbery to call them.

#  Pharmacy Thief Hits Ulm Drug Store with ratiopharm Blackjack

Ulm, a small town in southern Germany, made headlines this week when a pharmacy thief used ratiopharm Blackjack to rob the store. The thief, who has not been identified, made off with an unknown amount of prescription medication.

According to local police, the robber entered the store just before closing and handed the pharmacist a note demanding pills. When the pharmacist didn't immediately hand over any drugs, the thief pulled out ratiopharm Blackjack and threatened her with it. Fearing for her safety, the pharmacist relented and gave the thief several boxes of prescription medication.

This is not the first time that ratiopharm Blackjack has been used in a robbery. In 2016, a similar incident occurred in Cologne when a thief used the drug to rob a pharmacy. That robber made off with nearly â‚¬10,000 worth of drugs.

While ratiopharm Blackjack is not as popular as other synthetic opioids like fentanyl or carfentanil, it is still deadly in large doses. In fact, German police have issued a warning about ratiopharm Blackjack after several deaths have been linked to its use.

So far, there have been no reports of anyone dying as a result of this latest robbery in Ulm. However, local police are still investigating and are asking anyone with information about the thief to come forward.
