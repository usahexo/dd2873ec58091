There's a new card game on the market that is gaining traction for its celebration of diversity and love. Mooncraft is a cooperative card game where players must work together in order to create a lunar colony. The game takes place over 10 rounds, during which players will encounter various challenges, such as building homes, gathering resources, and maintaining the health of their colonists.

What really sets Mooncraft apart from other card games is its message of love and diversity. In a world that often seems full of hate and division, it's refreshing to see a game that celebrates all forms of life. "We wanted to make a game for everyone, that reflected the beauty and diversity of life," said Satnam Singh, one of the creators of Mooncraft. "Everyone should feel welcome in our lunar colony."

Mooncraft is currently funding on Kickstarter, and has already surpassed its goal with over 1,500 backers. If you're looking for a fun and unique card game that celebrates diversity and love, then be sure to check out Mooncraft!
