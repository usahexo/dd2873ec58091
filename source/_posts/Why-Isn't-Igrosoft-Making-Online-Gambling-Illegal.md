#  Why Isn't Igrosoft Making Online Gambling Illegal?

Igrosoft, a Russian software development company, is one of the leading providers of gaming software in the world. While their products are used by casino operators all over the globe, they have failed to make online gambling illegal. This may seem like an odd decision for a company that stands to make so much money from online gambling, but there are several reasons why Igrosoft may not want to make online gambling illegal.

The first reason is that Igrosoft already has a large market share in the online gambling industry. If they were to make online gambling illegal, they would lose out on this business and would likely see their market share decline. Additionally, making online gambling illegal could cause several legal challenges for Igrosoft. This could lead to negative publicity and even lawsuits from players who feel that their rights have been violated.

Finally, it's possible that Igrosoft doesn't actually see online gambling as being that harmful. The company may believe that allowing people to gamble online is better than forcing them to gamble at physical casinos. This is especially true in countries where gambling is tightly regulated, such as Russia. By allowing people to gamble online, Igrosoft can ensure that players are getting a safe and fair experience without having to leave their homes.

#  Igrosoft Opts Out of Online Gambling

The Russian software giant Igrosoft has announced that it will not be entering the online gambling market. This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Igrosoft is one of the largest and most successful software providers in Russia.

According to a statement from the company, Igrosoft decided against entering the online gambling market due to "uncertainties about the future of the industry." The statement also mentioned that Igrosoft plans to focus on developing its core business, which is offline gambling.

This announcement comes at a time when the Russian online gambling market is growing rapidly. In fact, according to a study by H2 Gambling Capital, the Russian online gambling market is expected to grow by more than 20% per year through 2020.

Despite this growth, the Russian online gambling market is still relatively small compared to other countries. For example, in 2017, the Russian online gambling market generated just over $1.5 billion in revenue. By comparison, the UK online gambling market generated over $7 billion in revenue during the same year.

#  Is Igrosoft Holding Back on Making Online Gambling Illegal?

The Russian software developer Igrosoft has been in the news lately as it is being speculated that the company may be holding back on making its games illegal for online gambling. This accusation comes as a bit of a surprise because Igrosoft has always been a staunch opponent of gambling and has never released any of its games for online use.

Part of the speculation around Igrosoft’s change of heart comes from the fact that the company’s management has changed in recent months. The new management is thought to be more open to the idea of developing games for online gambling sites. Additionally, there have been some unconfirmed reports that Igrosoft may have even struck deals with some gambling operators.

If these reports are true, it would mean a significant shift in Igrosoft’s position on gambling and would likely anger a lot of the company’s longtime fans. Igrosoft has always been known for its high-quality arcade games, and many people are concerned that releasing those same games for use in online casinos would cheapen their image.

So far, Igrosoft has not confirmed or denied any rumors regarding its plans to develop games for online gambling sites. However, we will likely know more in the coming months as the Russian government is set to reveal new regulations on gambling early next year.

#  Why Doesn't Igrosoft Support Online Gambling?

Igrosoft is a Russian software development company that creates video slot games and gaming machines. The company has a long history, dating back to 1994, but surprisingly doesn't offer any online gambling products or services.

There are several reasons why Igrosoft may have chosen not to develop an online gambling product. First, the Russian market for online gambling is small and relatively underdeveloped. The Russian government also imposes tight restrictions on the industry, which could make it difficult for Igrosoft to compete.

Additionally, Igrosoft may feel that the potential profits from online gambling are not worth the regulatory risks and costs associated with the industry. Russian authorities have been known to crackdown on unlicensed online gambling operations, so Igrosoft may be concerned about potential legal issues.

Finally, Igrosoft may simply not think that there is a large enough market for online gambling in Russia. With only a fraction of the population actually engaging in online gambling, it's possible that Igrosoft doesn't see this as a lucrative opportunity.

Despite the lack of an online gambling product, Igrosoft has still been successful in the Russian market. The company's video slot games are very popular in Russia, and it has developed a strong brand among casino gamers. This may be enough for Igrosoft to continue focusing on its core business and avoid entering the competitive online gambling market.

#  Igrosoft's Stance on Online Gambling Could Hurt Business

Igrosoft, the Russian software development company, has been largely absent from the online gambling market. And while the company has not revealed its reasons for this decision, it may have something to do with Russia's stance on the industry.

Like many countries, Russia prohibits gambling in most of its territory. But in late 2013, the Russian government moved to clarify its stance on online gambling, with officials stating that such activity is only legal if it takes place on websites licensed by the Russian gaming authority.

This ruling shut down many of the country's existing online gambling operations and made it difficult for new ones to get up and running. And since Igrosoft does not have a presence in the online gambling space, it is at a disadvantage compared to companies like Playtech and NetEnt, which do operate in Russia.

This could hurt Igrosoft's business in two ways. First, the company may miss out on revenue from licensing its software to Russian-based online casinos. Second, Igrosoft may find it harder to win contracts from Russian land-based casinos, as these establishments may prefer to work with suppliers that are licensed to operate in Russia.

The Russian government has been vague about when – or even if – it will relax its stance on online gambling. In the meantime, Igrosoft may be wise to reconsider its position and enter this growing market.
